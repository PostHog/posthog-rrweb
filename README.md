# PostHog's copy of RRWeb

this is open because we believe in open source
and we want to be able to contribute back to upstream rrweb and refer back to this when we do

but please don't use it yourself

all changes will be only focussed on posthog and we won't make any effort to support anybody else using this

if you say "i started using this, you changed it, and now my thing broke"
we will say "we told you not to use it"

The upstream rrweb is here https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb

## Hello internal PostHog folk

We build this and publish it to NPM so that we can use it in posthog-js

If you want to contribute a change  back to upstream rrweb
then you need to open a person fork and contribute from there
